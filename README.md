This is a personal project, I am learning and making this server simultaneously. This means this is not a complete project, lacking different sets of features. This is probably the most insecure server that exists to date. But as time passes I'll implement more and more functions and make it secure. </br>

What this server can do: </br>
 </br>
Listen to client requests: YES </br>
Responses based on requests: YES </br>
Open Files from the filesystem: YES </br>
Send Files over the network: YES </br>
Secure: NO </br>
Handles GET Requests: YES (With an exception to blank directory) </br>
Handles POST Requests: NO </br>
Error handling Page: YES </br>
 </br>
