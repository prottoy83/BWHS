A lightweight basic HTTP Server made with JAVA

This is a personal project, I am learning and making this server simultaneously. Which means this is not a complete project, lacking different sets of features. This is probably the most insecure server that exists to date. But as time passes I'll impliment more and more functions and make it secure.


What this server able to do:

Listen to client requests: YES
Differ requests: YES
Open Files from filesystem: 
Send Files over network: NO
Responses based on requests: NO
