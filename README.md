A lightweight basic HTTP Server made with JAVA

This is a personal project, I am learning and making this server simultaneously. This means this is not a complete project, lacking different sets of features. This is probably the most insecure server that exists to date. But as time passes I'll implement more and more functions and make it secure.


What this server can do:

Listen to client requests: YES
Responses based on requests: YES
Open Files from the filesystem: YES
Send Files over the network: YES
Secure: NO
Handles GET Requests: YES (With an exception to blank directory)
Handles POST Requests: NO

How to use this server?
-Run Server.java from src/

What is htsrc directory?
-It is where the html,css,javascript etc files are located.
